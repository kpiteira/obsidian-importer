I understand your concern about the previous task list leading to disjointed implementation. Let's create a more cohesive approach that ensures we build V2 incrementally with testable milestones along the way.

Here's a different format that focuses on vertical slices of functionality instead of horizontally divided tasks:

# Obsidian Importer V2 - Implementation Plan

## Approach Overview

Instead of breaking down tasks by component, we'll organize work into **incremental vertical slices** that deliver testable functionality at each stage. Each slice will:

1. Include all necessary changes across multiple components
2. Result in a testable plugin state
3. Build on previous slices without major refactoring
4. Include integration tests that verify the end-to-end flow

## Testing Strategy

For each slice:

1. **Unit tests** focus on the specific components being modified
2. **Integration tests** verify the end-to-end flow for that slice
3. **Manual verification** ensures the plugin works in Obsidian

After each slice is completed, you'll have a working plugin that can be tested with real content, making it easier to identify and fix issues before moving to the next slice.

## Development Workflow

1. Complete one slice at a time
2. Verify the plugin works end-to-end after each slice
3. Commit changes with descriptive messages related to the slice
4. If issues are found with previous slices, fix them before continuing

This approach ensures that at any point in development, you have a working plugin with clearly defined functionality.
