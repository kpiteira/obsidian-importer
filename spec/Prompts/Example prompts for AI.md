Okay, absolutely. Adopting that hybrid approach is a great way to leverage AI effectively. Here are a couple of example prompts, illustrating how you might combine information from your documents for specific tasks.

The key is to provide:

1.  **Clear Goal:** What code should be generated?
2.  **Specific Task:** Reference the task from your detailed list.
3.  **Architectural Context:** Provide the relevant design, code snippets, interfaces, or descriptions from your architecture doc.
4.  **PRD Context (Optional but helpful):** Briefly mention the user-facing goal if it clarifies the task.
5.  **Constraints/Environment:** Specify language (TypeScript), framework (Obsidian plugin), and any specific functions or APIs to use.

**Example Prompt 1: Implementing the URL Input Modal (UI Component)**

```prompt
Objective: Generate the TypeScript code for the URL input modal for my Obsidian plugin.

Task Definition (from obsidian_importer_detailed_tasks.md):
- Task 1.2.1: Create URL input modal
  - [ ] Task 1.2.1.1: Implement `UrlInputModal` class extending Obsidian's Modal component with proper title and styling
  - [ ] Task 1.2.1.2: Add input field for URL with Enter key handling and focus management
  - [ ] Task 1.2.1.3: Implement URL validation function with security checks for localhost/internal IPs (127.0.0.1, 192.168.x.x, etc.)
  - [ ] Task 1.2.1.4: Add error display for invalid URLs with clear user feedback message

Architectural Context (from obsidian_importer_architecture.md, Section 2.1):
- The modal should be triggered by the "Import content from URL" command.
- It needs a text input field for the URL.
- On submit (or Enter key press):
  - Basic URL validation (syntax + SSRF prevention) must occur using a function like `isValidUrl`.
  - If valid, call the provided `onSubmit` callback with the URL and close the modal.
  - If invalid, show an Obsidian `Notice` with an error message (e.g., "Please enter a valid URL.") and *do not* close the modal.
- Use Obsidian's `Modal` class as the base.
- Here's the example structure provided in the architecture document:
  ```ts
  import { App, Modal, Notice } from 'obsidian';

  // Assume isValidUrl function exists elsewhere and returns boolean
  declare function isValidUrl(url: string): boolean;

  class UrlInputModal extends Modal {
    onSubmit: (url: string) => void;

    constructor(app: App, onSubmit: (url: string) => void) {
      super(app);
      this.onSubmit = onSubmit;
    }

    onOpen() {
      const { contentEl } = this;
      contentEl.createEl("h2", { text: "Paste URL to import" });

      const inputEl = contentEl.createEl("input", { type: "text", attr: { style: "width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;" }}); // Added basic styling
      inputEl.focus(); // Focus on input when opened

      inputEl.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
        if (event.key === "Enter") {
          event.preventDefault(); // Prevent default form submission if wrapped in form
          const url = inputEl.value.trim();
          if (isValidUrl(url)) { // Use the validation function
            this.onSubmit(url);
            this.close();
          } else {
            new Notice("Please enter a valid URL."); // Show notice on error
            // Optionally highlight the input field or provide more specific feedback
          }
        }
      });

      // Optional: Add a submit button as well
      const submitButton = contentEl.createEl("button", { text: "Import" });
      submitButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
         const url = inputEl.value.trim();
         if (isValidUrl(url)) {
           this.onSubmit(url);
           this.close();
         } else {
           new Notice("Please enter a valid URL.");
         }
      });
    }

    onClose() {
      const { contentEl } = this;
      contentEl.empty();
    }
  }
  ```
- The `isValidUrl` function should check for http/https protocols and block localhost/internal IPs (like 127.x.x.x, ::1).

PRD Context (from obsidian_importer_prd.md, Section 7):
- This modal is the primary user interaction point for triggering the import. It should be simple and require only pasting a URL.

Instructions:
- Generate the complete TypeScript code for the `UrlInputModal` class, including necessary imports from 'obsidian'.
- Implement the `isValidUrl` function as described (it can be a standalone function or a private method). Ensure it handles the SSRF checks mentioned.
- Place the code in a file named `src/ui/UrlInputModal.ts`.
- Ensure the 'Enter' keypress triggers validation and submit.
- Use `new Notice(...)` for displaying errors to the user.
```

*Why this works:* It clearly states the goal, links to the specific tasks, provides the architectural blueprint including example code and constraints (use Obsidian API, SSRF checks), mentions the user-facing goal from the PRD, and specifies the output file.

**Example Prompt 2: Implementing the Content Type Detector (Core Logic)**

```prompt
Objective: Generate TypeScript code for the content type detection logic for my Obsidian plugin.

Task Definition (from obsidian_importer_detailed_tasks.md):
- Task 1.2.2: Implement content type detection
  - [ ] Task 1.2.2.1: Create `ContentTypeHandler` interface with `detect(url: URL): boolean` and `type: string` properties
  - [ ] Task 1.2.2.2: Implement `YouTubeHandler` class for detecting YouTube URLs (youtube.com, youtu.be domains)
  - [ ] Task 1.2.2.3: Create detection dispatcher function to find appropriate handler for a given URL
  - [ ] Task 1.2.2.4: Add error handling for unsupported content types with user-friendly messages

Architectural Context (from obsidian_importer_architecture.md, Section 2.2):
- The system needs to determine the content type from a URL. MVP only needs to support YouTube.
- It should use a strategy pattern with a `ContentTypeHandler` interface.
- The interface definition:
  ```ts
  interface ContentTypeHandler {
    detect(url: URL): boolean;
    type: string; // e.g., 'youtube'
  }
  ```
- Implement a `YouTubeHandler` conforming to this interface. It should return `true` if the URL hostname includes 'youtube.com' or 'youtu.be'.
- Create a dispatcher function `detectContentType(rawUrl: string): string | null`.
  - This function takes a raw URL string.
  - It should safely parse the URL using `new URL()`. Handle potential parsing errors.
  - It iterates through a list of registered handlers (initially just `YouTubeHandler`).
  - If a handler's `detect` method returns `true`, the dispatcher returns the handler's `type` string (e.g., 'youtube').
  - If no handler matches or if the URL is invalid, it should return `null` (or perhaps 'unknown' or throw an error - let's return `null` for now).
- Example dispatcher structure provided:
  ```ts
  // Assume YouTubeHandler is defined and implements ContentTypeHandler
  const handlers: ContentTypeHandler[] = [
    new YouTubeHandler(),
    // Future handlers go here
  ];

  function detectContentType(rawUrl: string): string | null { // Changed return type for clarity
    try {
      const url = new URL(rawUrl);
      for (const handler of handlers) { // Iterate through handlers
        if (handler.detect(url)) {
          return handler.type;
        }
      }
      return null; // No handler matched
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("Invalid URL for type detection:", rawUrl, e);
      return null; // URL parsing failed
    }
  }
  ```

PRD Context (from obsidian_importer_prd.md, Section 3 & 5):
- MVP scope is limited to YouTube videos.
- The system needs to identify YouTube links to trigger the correct processing pipeline.

Instructions:
- Generate the TypeScript code for:
  1. The `ContentTypeHandler` interface.
  2. The `YouTubeHandler` class implementing the interface, detecting based on the specified hostnames.
  3. The `detectContentType(rawUrl: string): string | null` dispatcher function.
- Include necessary error handling for URL parsing within the dispatcher.
- Place this code in a file named `src/handlers/typeDetector.ts`.
- Ensure the `YouTubeHandler` accurately checks *both* specified hostnames.
```

*Why this works:* It defines the specific functions and interface needed, provides the exact logic for detection (hostnames) and dispatching, includes the code structure from the architecture, clarifies the expected return values (`null` on failure/no match), and links it back to the MVP requirement from the PRD.

These examples show how to mix precise task definitions with architectural context and code examples to guide the AI effectively within the hybrid approach. You can adjust the level of detail based on the complexity of the task and how much specific guidance you want to provide versus letting the AI infer.


---

Okay, let's craft some hybrid prompts for the "Project Setup and Configuration" tasks (1.1.x). These tend to involve setting up files, configurations, and project structures, so the prompts will focus on file creation/modification and specific content.

---

**Example Prompt Group 1: Scaffolding Project Structure (Task 1.1.1)**

*Note: Since Task 1.1.1.1 involves cloning a repo, it's usually done manually. The prompts will focus on the subsequent setup.*

**Prompt 1.1 (manifest.json):**

```prompt
Objective: Update the `manifest.json` file for the Obsidian Importer plugin project.

Task Definition (from obsidian_importer_detailed_tasks.md):
- [ ] Task 1.1.1.2: Update plugin metadata in `manifest.json` with name "Obsidian Importer", ID "obsidian-importer", and appropriate description

Architectural Context (from obsidian_importer_architecture.md, Section 4.1):
- `manifest.json` declares plugin metadata for Obsidian.
- It's a standard part of the Obsidian plugin template structure.

Instructions:
- Assume I have cloned the Obsidian sample plugin template.
- Provide the complete JSON content for `manifest.json`.
- Use the following metadata:
  - id: "obsidian-importer"
  - name: "Obsidian Importer"
  - version: "1.0.0" (or a suitable starting version)
  - minAppVersion: "1.0.0" (use a reasonable minimum Obsidian version, e.g., 1.0.0 or higher)
  - description: "Imports content (e.g., YouTube videos) from a URL, processes it with an LLM, and creates a formatted note in Obsidian."
  - author: "[Your Name/Handle]"
  - authorUrl: "[Your Website/GitHub Profile URL (optional)]"
  - isDesktopOnly: false
```

**Prompt 1.2 (Folder Structure):**

```prompt
Objective: Create the necessary source code folder structure for the Obsidian Importer plugin.

Task Definition (from obsidian_importer_detailed_tasks.md):
- [ ] Task 1.1.1.3: Create folder structure according to architecture doc: `src/handlers/`, `src/ui/`, `src/utils/`, `src/models/`, `src/services/`

Architectural Context (from obsidian_importer_architecture.md, Section 4.1):
- The recommended file structure organizes code into logical components:
  ```
  obsidian-importer/
  ├── src/                     # Main source code folder
  │   ├── handlers/            # Core pipeline components (detection, download, process, write)
  │   ├── ui/                  # Modals, settings tabs
  │   ├── utils/               # Helper functions (validation, sanitization)
  │   ├── models/              # Data interfaces (e.g., YouTubeVideoData, PluginSettings)
  │   ├── services/            # External service interactions (e.g., LLM API calls)
  │   └── main.ts              # Plugin entry point
  ├── tests/                   # Test files
  ├── manifest.json
  ├── tsconfig.json
  └── package.json
  ```
- Note: `main.ts` likely already exists in the template's `src/` or root; it should remain.

Instructions:
- Generate a list of shell commands (e.g., `mkdir`) to create the following directories inside the `src/` folder of the project:
  - `handlers`
  - `ui`
  - `utils`
  - `models`
  - `services`
- Assume the commands are run from the project's root directory.
```

**Prompt 1.3 (tsconfig.json):**

```prompt
Objective: Configure the `tsconfig.json` file for the Obsidian Importer TypeScript project.

Task Definition (from obsidian_importer_detailed_tasks.md):
- [ ] Task 1.1.1.4: Set up TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json` with strict type checking and appropriate module resolution

Architectural Context (from obsidian_importer_architecture.md, Section 4.1):
- The project uses TypeScript.
- The Obsidian sample plugin template includes a base `tsconfig.json`.
- We need to ensure strict type checking is enabled for better code quality.

Instructions:
- Provide the recommended JSON content for the `tsconfig.json` file.
- Ensure the configuration includes:
  - `"target": "ES6"` (or newer, compatible with Obsidian's Electron version)
  - `"module": "ESNext"`
  - `"moduleResolution": "node"`
  - `"strict": true` (Enable all strict type-checking options)
  - `"esModuleInterop": true`
  - `"outDir": "./"` (or wherever the build output is configured, often root for main.js)
  - `"rootDir": "src"`
  - Include any other necessary compiler options commonly used for Obsidian plugin development (like `lib`, `sourceMap`, `allowJs`, `declaration`). You can base this on the standard template's tsconfig if available, but ensure `strict` is true.
```

---

**Example Prompt Group 2: Setting up Development Environment (Task 1.1.2)**

*Note: Installing dependencies (1.1.2.1) is usually a manual `npm install`. Setting up symlinks (1.1.2.4) often requires manual steps based on the OS and Obsidian vault location.*

**Prompt 2.1 (Build Scripts):**

```prompt
Objective: Define npm scripts in `package.json` for building the Obsidian Importer plugin.

Task Definition (from obsidian_importer_detailed_tasks.md):
- [ ] Task 1.1.2.2: Configure build system with npm scripts for development (`npm run dev`) and production builds (`npm run build`)

Architectural Context (from obsidian_importer_architecture.md, Section 4.1):
- The Obsidian sample plugin template usually uses Rollup or esbuild for bundling.
- A `dev` script should enable watching files for changes and rebuilding automatically.
- A `build` script should create a production-ready `main.js` bundle.

Instructions:
- Provide the JSON snippet for the `"scripts"` section of `package.json`.
- Include two scripts:
  - `dev`: Should run the build tool (assume `esbuild` or `rollup` based on the template, e.g., `rollup -c --watch`) to watch for changes and rebuild.
  - `build`: Should run the build tool for a production build (e.g., `rollup -c`).
- If specific build configuration files are standard (like `rollup.config.js` or `esbuild.config.mjs`), mention them as dependencies for these scripts to work. (You don't need to generate the content of those config files here).
```

**Prompt 2.2 (Test Setup):**

```prompt
Objective: Set up the testing environment using Vitest for the Obsidian Importer plugin.

Task Definition (from obsidian_importer_detailed_tasks.md):
- [ ] Task 1.1.2.3: Set up testing environment with Vitest and create initial test structure in a `tests/` folder

Architectural Context (from obsidian_importer_architecture.md, Section 4.2):
- Recommends using Vitest for testing.
- Suggests a `tests/` folder mirroring the `src/` structure where appropriate.
- Suggests storing fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`.

Instructions:
1.  List the necessary npm dev dependencies to install for Vitest (`vitest`, potentially `@vitest/ui`, `jsdom` or similar for mocking browser/Obsidian APIs if needed).
2.  Provide the command(s) to create the initial test directory structure:
    - `tests/handlers/`
    - `tests/ui/`
    - `tests/utils/`
    - `tests/fixtures/`
3.  Suggest a basic npm script in `package.json` to run the tests, e.g., `"test": "vitest"`.
```

**Example Prompt Group 3: Creating Settings Module (Task 1.1.3)**

**Prompt 3.1 (Settings Interface & Defaults):**

```prompt
Objective: Define the settings interface and default values for the Obsidian Importer plugin.

Task Definition (from obsidian_importer_detailed_tasks.md):
- [ ] Task 1.1.3.1: Define settings interface with required fields (apiKey, llmEndpoint, model, defaultFolder)
- [ ] Task 1.1.3.2: Implement settings storage using Obsidian's data API and plugin data interface

Architectural Context (from obsidian_importer_architecture.md, Section 3.4):
- Settings needed: `apiKey`, `llmEndpoint`, `model`, `defaultFolder`, `promptTemplate` (optional override), `debug`.
- Defaults suggested:
  - `llmEndpoint`: Requesty default URL (Use placeholder like "REQUESTY_DEFAULT_URL")
  - `model`: e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`
  - `defaultFolder`: `Imported/YouTube` (Note: Architecture discussion suggested `Imported/` might be simpler, but let's stick to the task list's implied default for now, or clarify)
  - `promptTemplate`: Default is hardcoded, so empty string "" or null initially for the setting value.
  - `debug`: `false`

Instructions:
- Generate TypeScript code for a file named `src/settings.ts`.
- This file should contain:
  1. An interface named `PluginSettings` defining all the fields listed in the architecture (`apiKey`: string, `llmEndpoint`: string, `model`: string, `defaultFolder`: string, `promptTemplate`: string, `debug`: boolean).
  2. A constant named `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` of type `PluginSettings` containing the default values specified above. Use placeholder values for API Key ("") and the Requesty URL if the exact URL isn't known. Use `Imported/YouTube` as the default folder based on the architecture table (even though text suggested simpler).
```

**Prompt 3.2 (Settings Tab UI):**

```prompt
Objective: Create the basic structure for the Settings Tab UI for the Obsidian Importer plugin.

Task Definition (from obsidian_importer_detailed_tasks.md):
- [ ] Task 1.1.3.3: Create settings tab UI with input fields for LLM configuration (API key, endpoint URL)

Architectural Context (from obsidian_importer_architecture.md, Section 3.4):
- Use Obsidian's `PluginSettingTab` class.
- Needs input fields for `apiKey`, `llmEndpoint`, `model`, `defaultFolder`.
- Needs a toggle for `debug` mode.
- Needs a text area for `promptTemplate` override.
- Settings should be saved using the plugin's `saveSettings` method when changed.

Instructions:
- Generate the TypeScript code for a class named `ImporterSettingTab` that extends `PluginSettingTab`.
- Place it in a file named `src/ui/ImporterSettingTab.ts`.
- Include necessary imports (`App`, `Plugin`, `PluginSettingTab`, `Setting` from 'obsidian').
- Implement the `display()` method.
- Inside `display()`, create settings UI elements using `new Setting(containerEl)` for:
  - LLM API Key (`apiKey`): Use `addText` and set input type to `password`.
  - LLM Endpoint URL (`llmEndpoint`): Use `addText`.
  - LLM Model (`model`): Use `addText`.
  - Default Import Folder (`defaultFolder`): Use `addText`.
  - Debug Mode (`debug`): Use `addToggle`.
  - Prompt Template Override (`promptTemplate`): Use `addTextArea`.
- For each setting, ensure it reads the current value from `this.plugin.settings` and calls `this.plugin.saveSettings()` after the value is changed (`onChange` event).
- Add basic names and descriptions to each setting using `.setName()` and `.setDesc()`.
```

These prompts break down the setup into manageable chunks, providing the AI with the necessary context from your detailed tasks and architecture to generate the initial project files and configurations. Remember to review and refine the generated code.
