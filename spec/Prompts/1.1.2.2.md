Objective: Define npm scripts in `package.json` for building the Obsidian Importer plugin.

Task Definition (from obsidian_importer_detailed_tasks.md):
- [ ] Task 1.1.2.2: Configure build system with npm scripts for development (`npm run dev`) and production builds (`npm run build`)

Architectural Context (from obsidian_importer_architecture.md, Section 4.1):
- The Obsidian sample plugin template usually uses Rollup or esbuild for bundling.
- A `dev` script should enable watching files for changes and rebuilding automatically.
- A `build` script should create a production-ready `main.js` bundle.

Instructions:
- Provide the JSON snippet for the `"scripts"` section of `package.json`.
- Include two scripts:
  - `dev`: Should run the build tool (assume `esbuild` or `rollup` based on the template, e.g., `rollup -c --watch`) to watch for changes and rebuild.
  - `build`: Should run the build tool for a production build (e.g., `rollup -c`).
- If specific build configuration files are standard (like `rollup.config.js` or `esbuild.config.mjs`), mention them as dependencies for these scripts to work. (You don't need to generate the content of those config files here).
