kpiteira: I completed the implementation of my plugin MVP. I would like now to start my v2. My PRD for the MVP (provided here) had some ideas for the V2. I would like to write a detailed PRD for V2 based on these ideas. Can you please help me? Please note that this is a brainstorming together, and I would appreciate if you asked me questions so that we can refine the content of the PRD together, instead of just 1-shot producing the v2 prd on your own. Once we're done, we will write the output of the PRD in a new markdown file to preserve the existing one.

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationI'd be happy to help you brainstorm and create a detailed PRD for version 2 of your Obsidian Importer plugin. This collaborative approach will help us refine the requirements effectively.

Looking at your current PRD, I can see you have some initial ideas for V2:
- Supporting additional content types beyond YouTube
- More flexibility in LLM model selection
- UI improvements

Let's start by exploring these areas with some questions:

### Content Types
1. Which specific content types from your "Eventually" list would you like to prioritize for V2? 
2. Are there any challenges or unique considerations for each content type you're concerned about?
3. What's your strategy for content extraction for different sources (e.g., APIs, web scraping)?

### LLM Model Selection
1. Do you have specific providers in mind beyond the ones mentioned (Requesty, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Ollama)?
2. What criteria would users use to select models (cost, speed, quality, token limits)?
3. How would you like to handle API keys for different providers?

### UI Improvements
1. What specific UI pain points have you identified in V1?
2. Would you like to add any visualization features for the import process?
3. Are there any settings or configuration UI improvements you'd like to make?

Additionally:
- Have you received any user feedback from V1 that would influence V2 priorities?
- Are there any technical limitations you encountered in V1 that need addressing?
- Do you have any performance concerns as you add more content types?

Let's start with these questions and build our V2 PRD from there.

kpiteira: Content Types:
1. I want to try all of them. If it proves too difficult, here is the priority ordered list: Medium articles, Books (from Goodreads), Recipes, Restaurants, Movies, Images
2. Medium should be easy as it's all in one website (https://medium.com/). Books also as it's from GoodReads (https://www.goodreads.com/). Recipes, Restaurants and Movies are likely to come from any place of the web; There will likely be a first pass to detect if the page at the URL is one of these, to figure out which handler it is in our content detection phase. For Images I am not sure yet what I want, probably safer to leave that for later actually.
3. very likely web scraping
LLM Model Selection
1. These are the only one I can think of. We can increase that list later if that's useful
2. Very likely cost, fit to purpose and quality.
3. We should store them in the Obsidian secret management system, and when the use selects a provider, if they previously provided an API key, the system will find it again, otherwise it will ask for it
UI Improvements
In spec/obsidian_importer_architecture_mvp_implementation.md, we have an analysis by you of the implementation vs the original architecture, but it also contains some UI enhancement suggestions that I'd like to explore.
The settings we discussed above are also UI improvements.
Finally our modal is not very interesting, I don't know how to improve it but I'd love to get some suggestions!

GitHub Copilot: Thank you for these detailed answers! Now I have a better understanding of your vision for V2. Let's explore each area further.

### Content Types
I see you want to try implementing all content types, with a priority order if needed. For Medium articles and Books via Goodreads, the source is consistent, making implementation more straightforward. For content types that could come from various websites (Recipes, Restaurants, Movies), we'll need a content detection system.

A few follow-up questions:
1. For each content type, do you want default templates similar to your YouTube template?
2. For Medium articles, would you want to handle paywalled content differently?
3. For the generic content types (Recipes, etc.), are there any specific websites you'd want to optimize for first?

### LLM Model Selection
Your approach to API key management using Obsidian's secret system makes sense. A few questions:

1. Would you like the system to recommend models based on the content type (e.g., suggesting cheaper models for short content)?
2. Should users be able to set different default models for different content types?
3. Would you want to include any model performance metrics or estimated costs in the UI?

### UI Improvements
Let's discuss potential improvements to your modal and overall UX:

1. Would you be interested in a preview capability that shows what the note might look like before finalizing?
2. How about a status indicator during processing (content extraction → LLM processing → note creation)?
3. Would you want any batch processing capabilities (multiple URLs at once)?

Let me know your thoughts on these questions, and we can continue refining the V2 PRD.

kpiteira: Content Types
1. Likely not, although they will be similar, they will have different categories, and definitely different metadata!
2. That's a great point that I had not thought about as I have a subscription. I am not sure how to let the plugin have access to the article via the subscription of the user.
3. No, I don't think so. My idea/hope is that the LLM will be able to find the list of ingredients and description of the steps for recipes for example since they all have more or less the same structure, even if they often are presented differently

LLM Model Selection
1. I'd really like to, but I don't know how technically difficult that would be so I'd like this to be the ideal case, with a fallback where the user just has to make the decision in a list, and potentially leave it to v3 to further improve
2. Let's leave that for v3 (make a note of it)
3. same, in v3

UI Improvements
1. No: by that point most of the work is done. However opening the note after creating it would be definitely an improvement. The user can always delete it if they do';t like it
2. I feel we already have that today, but there is no sense of progress, just the status. Giving a sense of progress would be nice
3. v3 or beyond

GitHub Copilot: Thanks for clarifying those points! Let's continue refining the V2 requirements based on your feedback.

For content types, I understand you'll want distinct templates with different categories and metadata for each content type. And regarding Medium paywalled content, that's indeed a challenge since it would require user authentication.

For LLM model selection, we'll aim for intelligent model recommendations but keep a simpler fallback option ready, with more advanced features saved for V3.

For UI improvements, opening the note automatically after creation sounds like a good enhancement, and improving the progress indicator would help users understand what's happening during processing.

Let me now suggest a draft structure for your V2 PRD. Based on our conversation, here's how I'd organize it:

# Obsidian Importer V2 PRD Structure

1. **Overview and Goals for V2**
2. **New Content Types**
   - Implementation priority
   - Content detection strategy
   - Extraction approach for each type
   - Template structure for each type
3. **Enhanced LLM Integration**
   - Provider selection system
   - Model listing and selection
   - API key management
4. **UI Improvements**
   - Settings panel enhancements
   - Import modal improvements
   - Progress indication refinements
5. **Technical Considerations**
6. **Future Considerations for V3**

Does this structure align with your vision for the V2 PRD? Would you like to modify or add any sections before we start drafting the actual content?

kpiteira: yes this looks great, thank you!

GitHub Copilot: Great! Let's draft the V2 PRD content based on our discussion and the structure we agreed on.

First, let me check if there's anything from the architecture document you mentioned that I should consider for the UI improvements section before drafting. Do you have any specific points from that document you'd like to highlight?

Also, would you like to add any specific intro section explaining the evolution from V1 to V2, or shall we jump straight into the new requirements?

Let me know, and I'll start drafting the content for your V2 PRD.

kpiteira: you may look at `## 5. V2 Considerations and Next Steps`.
Out of these, I feel we did the content types and local llm support. The template management scares me and I'd like to put that in v3 (let's make a note of that in the prd).
Note merging is a cool idea but I don't feel the need right now. I love the idea of enhanced error recovery but I am not sure what that entails. Improved Metadata extraction: same thing. Vault integration: I love the idea, and we're more or less already doing that with the "Key Concepts" by adding links to other notes (via the `[[ ]]` marker), I'm not sure if the intention was deeper here, any ideas?
On the technical improvements, I like the all, except the perf optimization: I haven't observed perf issues since most of the time is waiting for io (download and llm).

GitHub Copilot: Thanks for sharing the architecture document! I now have a better understanding of your current implementation and what you're interested in for V2.

Based on your feedback:
- Content types and local LLM support will be our main focus
- Template management will be deferred to V3
- For Vault integration, we could enhance the current concept linking to be smarter about finding existing notes

Let me now draft the V2 PRD document:

# 🚀 Obsidian Importer V2 – Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview and Goals for V2

Building on the success of the MVP which focused on YouTube content imports, Obsidian Importer V2 expands the plugin's capabilities to support multiple content types and provide users with greater flexibility in LLM model selection. V2 aims to make the plugin more versatile while maintaining the streamlined user experience established in V1.

### Core Goals for V2:
- Support additional content types beyond YouTube videos
- Provide flexible LLM model selection across multiple providers
- Enhance the user interface with improved progress indication and workflow
- Implement more robust error handling and recovery
- Maintain architectural integrity while expanding functionality

## 2. New Content Types

### 2.1 Implementation Priority
1. Medium articles
2. Books (via Goodreads)
3. Recipes (generic web)
4. Restaurants (generic web)
5. Movies (generic web)

### 2.2 Content Detection Strategy
The content detection system will be enhanced to:
- Identify URLs from specific domains (Medium.com, Goodreads.com)
- Use pattern recognition and content analysis for generic content types
- Implement a content detection pipeline that allows for graceful fallback

### 2.3 Content Type Handler Framework
Each content type will implement the `ContentTypeHandler` interface, similar to the existing YouTube handler:

```typescript
export interface ContentTypeHandler {
  type: string;
  detect(url: URL): boolean;
  downloadContent(url: string): Promise<any>;
  getPrompt(content: any): string;
  parseLLMResponse(response: string): any;
  validateLLMOutput(parsed: any): boolean;
  getNoteContent(llmResponse: string, metadata: ContentMetadata): string;
  getFolderName(): string;
}
```

### 2.4 Content Type-Specific Templates

#### 📄 Medium Article Template
```markdown
# {{title}}

Author: {{author}}  🔗 [Read on Medium]({{article_url}})

## Summary
{{summary}}

## Highlights
{{highlights}}

## Key Topics
{{key_topics}}

## Metadata
- Published: {{published_date}}
- Read time: {{read_time}}
```

#### 📚 Book (Goodreads) Template
```markdown
# {{title}}

Author: [{{author}}]({{author_url}})  
🔗 [View on Goodreads]({{book_url}})  
📅 Published: {{published_date}}

![Cover]({{cover_image}})

## Summary
{{summary}}

## Themes
{{themes}}

## Key Highlights
{{highlights}}

## Key Concepts
{{key_concepts}}

## Metadata
- ISBN: {{isbn}}
- Pages: {{pages}}
- Rating: {{rating}}
```

#### 🍴 Recipe Template
```markdown
# {{recipe_name}}

🔗 [Source]({{source_url}})  

![Image]({{image_url}})

## Ingredients
{{ingredients}}

## Instructions
{{instructions}}

## Notes
{{notes}}

## Metadata
- Servings: {{servings}}
- Prep Time: {{prep_time}}
- Cook Time: {{cook_time}}
```

#### 🍽️ Restaurant Template and 🎬 Movie Template will follow similar structures with their relevant metadata fields.

### 2.5 Content Extraction Approach
- **Medium Articles**: Extract article text, author info, and publication data
- **Goodreads**: Extract book details, ratings, and description
- **Generic Content**: Use web scraping with intelligent content identification
- **Error Cases**: Implement fallback to generic extraction if specific extraction fails

## 3. Enhanced LLM Integration

### 3.1 Provider Selection System
- Implement a dropdown menu in settings for selecting LLM providers:
  - Requesty
  - OpenRouter
  - OpenAI
  - Local (e.g., Ollama)

### 3.2 Provider-Specific Configurations
- **Remote Providers**: Auto-configure endpoints based on provider selection
- **Local Provider**: Additional field for specifying endpoint URL (e.g., http://localhost:11434/v1)

### 3.3 Model Listing and Selection
- Implement a model selection dropdown that updates based on selected provider
- For providers with API access to model lists, fetch available models
- For providers without such APIs, maintain a curated list of common models

### 3.4 API Key Management
- Use Obsidian's secret management system to securely store API keys
- Remember previously entered keys for each provider
- Implement a "Test Connection" button to validate API settings

### 3.5 Provider Interface
Extend the LLM Provider interface to support multiple providers:

```typescript
export interface LLMProvider {
  getName(): string;
  getAvailableModels(): Promise<string[]>;
  callLLM(prompt: string, options?: LLMOptions): Promise<string>;
  validateConnection(): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

## 4. UI Improvements

### 4.1 Settings Panel Enhancements
- Reorganize settings into logical sections:
  - General Settings
  - LLM Configuration
  - Content Type Settings
- Add visual indicators for valid/invalid configuration
- Implement provider-specific setting fields that show/hide based on selection

### 4.2 Import Process Improvements
- Display more detailed progress indicators during import process
- Add percentage or step count to progress indicator (e.g., "Step 2/5: Downloading content")
- Automatically open newly created notes after import completion
- Add a "History" section showing recent imports with status (success/failure)

### 4.3 Error Handling & Recovery
- Implement more detailed error messages with suggested resolutions
- Add retry capability for failed operations
- Log detailed diagnostics to help troubleshoot issues
- Provide user-friendly error messages based on error type

## 5. Technical Considerations

### 5.1 Architecture Updates
- Maintain the orchestrator pattern while extending for multiple content types
- Implement a content type registry for dynamically loading handlers
- Enhance error recovery with retry mechanisms for network operations
- Implement a more formal state management approach

### 5.2 Testing Strategy
- Add unit tests for new content type handlers
- Implement integration tests for the provider selection system
- Add snapshot tests for template rendering

### 5.3 Documentation
- Generate comprehensive API documentation
- Create developer guides for adding new content types
- Update user documentation with new features

## 6. Future Considerations for V3

Features explicitly deferred to V3:
- Template management UI for customizing templates
- Setting different default models for different content types
- Displaying model performance metrics and estimated costs
- Batch processing capabilities for multiple URLs
- Note merging (updating existing notes instead of creating new ones)
- Advanced vault integration with fuzzy matching for backlinks
- Custom logic scripting for advanced template behavior
- Performance optimization for larger content

## 7. Timeline and Development Approach

### 7.1 Development Phases
1. **Core Infrastructure Updates** (2 weeks)
   - Implement provider selection system
   - Extend orchestrator for multiple content types
   - Update error handling system

2. **Content Type Implementation** (3-4 weeks)

kpiteira: This is great, thank you! I saved it in prd_v2.
I would like now to generate our detailed architecture document, using as a basis the one from the mvp (attached). Like in the previous step, please see this as a brainstorm, and do ask me questions so that we reach an optimal and detailed architecture document!

GitHub Copilot: I'd be happy to help you brainstorm a detailed architecture document for V2, using the MVP architecture document as a basis. This collaborative approach will help us refine the architecture effectively.

Looking at your MVP architecture document and the V2 PRD we just created, I can see we need to expand the architecture to support multiple content types and LLM providers, while maintaining the solid foundation you've already built.

Let's start with some key questions to guide our discussion:

### Content Type Architecture
1. How do you envision the content type registry working? Should it be a central registry that all handlers register with, or would you prefer lazy-loading handlers?
2. For the generic content handlers (recipes, restaurants, movies), do you want a single generic handler with specialized logic or completely separate handlers?

### LLM Provider Architecture
1. How should we handle the provider factory pattern? Should we extend your current factory approach or create a new provider registry?
2. For storing multiple API keys (one per provider), do you have a preference for the storage approach?

### Error Handling and Recovery
1. Would you like to implement specific retry strategies for different types of operations (network, LLM calls, etc.)?
2. How granular should error reporting be to users vs. logging for developers?

### State Management
1. The MVP architecture document mentions "more formal state management" - do you have specific ideas or would you like suggestions?
2. How would you like to handle the history of recent imports? As in-memory state, persistent storage, or both?

### UI Architecture
1. For the settings UI with dynamic fields based on provider selection, do you have a preference for how this should be implemented?
2. For the progress indication improvements, should we extend the current progress callback system or take a different approach?

Let's start with these questions and then we can dive deeper into specific areas.

kpiteira: Content Type Architecture
1. I suspect that to find the appropriate handler, we will have to go through most, so I am not sure of the benefit of the lazy loading approach - what was your view of the benefit in this specific case?
2. The Handlers do a lot of specific work beyond the detection of content type, therefore I am fairly convinced we should have separate ones. however, the detection should be somehow shared: for example (and I don't know if that's the right approach but it's an idea) the first handler of these types called would load the web page, analyse it through an llm call which would be the same for all 3 types which will determine the type (one of all the 3) and will return type; then the others don't need to do that anymore for this specific URL, through some kind of temporary KV pair URL/Type. Again, just an idea to have 3 handlers separate with specialized logic, but do type detection only once as it is costly. I am very open to your suggestions!

LLM Provider Architecture
1. No idea, what's your architect expert opinion?
2. No

Error Handling and Recovery
1. Potentially, it really depend on the error type. If it's a network error, that might make sense, but I suspect most error will tell us that it's not super useful to retry. We may want to discover the provider's error code interpretation for that.
2. We should report to users error that are actionnable for them, for example, an unavailable provider or an error in the endpoint might be: switch provider, or lack of credit could be the same; wrong API Key would prompt them to change their API key, things like that are good. Others should probably logged for developpers

State Management
1. Since you made that statement when you rewrote that document, I was hoping you had an idea :)
2. I'm not sure that's useful. That's not a feature I'd like to keep for v2

UI Architecture
1. no
2. If it is well designed, yes; otherwise I'm happy to have it changed! Please use your best judgement as an expert architect!

GitHub Copilot: Thanks for your thoughtful responses! Now I have a better understanding of your vision for the V2 architecture. Let's start drafting the architecture document based on your feedback and the existing MVP architecture.

For content type architecture, I see you're concerned about efficiency with detection, which makes sense. For LLM providers, you're open to suggestions on the factory pattern. For error handling, you want actionable errors for users. And for state management, you'd like suggestions.

Let me draft a detailed architecture document that addresses these points:

# 🏗️ Obsidian Importer V2 – Architecture Document

## 1. High-Level Architecture

Building on the MVP's orchestrator-based architecture, the V2 architecture expands to support multiple content types and LLM providers while maintaining the same core flow:

```
User Input (URL)
   ↓
UrlInputModal (UI Layer)
   ↓
ImportPipelineOrchestrator (Coordination)
   ↓
Content Type Detection → Content Download → LLM Processing → Note Creation
   ↑                        ↑                  ↑
Content Type Registry    Web Scraping      Provider Registry
```

The key architectural enhancements include:
- A content type registry for managing multiple content handlers
- An LLM provider registry for supporting multiple LLM services
- Enhanced error handling with actionable user feedback
- Improved progress reporting

---

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Entry Point (Plugin Main)

#### ✅ What it does
- Initializes the plugin, settings, and logger
- Registers the command palette item
- Sets up the enhanced settings tab with provider selection
- Creates and configures the content type registry and provider registry
- Delegates to the orchestrator for the main functionality

#### 🧱 Implementation

```ts
export default class ObsidianImporterPlugin extends Plugin {
  settings: PluginSettings;
  contentTypeRegistry: ContentTypeRegistry;
  providerRegistry: LLMProviderRegistry;
  
  async onload() {
    // Initialize registries
    this.contentTypeRegistry = new ContentTypeRegistry();
    this.providerRegistry = new LLMProviderRegistry();
    
    // Register content handlers
    this.contentTypeRegistry.register(new YouTubeHandler());
    this.contentTypeRegistry.register(new MediumHandler());
    this.contentTypeRegistry.register(new GoodreadsHandler());
    this.contentTypeRegistry.register(new RecipeHandler());
    this.contentTypeRegistry.register(new RestaurantHandler());
    this.contentTypeRegistry.register(new MovieHandler());
    
    // Register LLM providers
    this.providerRegistry.register(new RequestyProvider());
    this.providerRegistry.register(new OpenRouterProvider());
    this.providerRegistry.register(new OpenAIProvider());
    this.providerRegistry.register(new OllamaProvider());
    
    // Load settings
    await this.loadSettings();
    
    // Register command
    this.addCommand({
      id: 'import-from-url',
      name: 'Import from URL',
      callback: () => new UrlInputModal(this.app, this).open()
    });
    
    // Add settings tab
    this.addSettingTab(new ImprovedSettingTab(this.app, this));
  }
}
```

### 2.2 URL Input Modal (UI Layer)

The URL input modal is enhanced with improved progress reporting while maintaining its simple interface:

```ts
export class UrlInputModal extends Modal {
  constructor(app: App, plugin: ObsidianImporterPlugin) {
    super(app);
    this.plugin = plugin;
  }
  
  onOpen() {
    // Similar to MVP implementation, with enhanced progress reporting
    
    // Create orchestrator with current provider from settings
    const currentProvider = this.plugin.providerRegistry.getProvider(
      this.plugin.settings.selectedProvider
    );
    
    const orchestrator = createImportPipelineOrchestrator(
      this.app,
      this.plugin.settings,
      getLogger(),
      currentProvider,
      this.plugin.contentTypeRegistry
    );
    
    // Setup UI elements with improved progress reporting
    
    // Track progress with percentage/step information
    orchestrator.on('progress', (stage, detail, stepNumber, totalSteps) => {
      // Update progress display with more detailed information
    });
    
    // Handle completion by opening the created note
    orchestrator.on('complete', (notePath) => {
      this.close();
      // Open the created note
      this.app.workspace.openLinkText(notePath, '', true);
    });
  }
}
```

### 2.3 Content Type Registry

A new component for V2 that manages content type handlers and implements an efficient detection strategy:

```ts
export class ContentTypeRegistry {
  private handlers: ContentTypeHandler[] = [];
  private detectionCache: Map<string, string> = new Map();
  private pageContentCache: Map<string, string> = new Map();
  
  register(handler: ContentTypeHandler): void {
    this.handlers.push(handler);
  }
  
  async detectContentType(url: string): Promise<ContentTypeHandler> {
    // Check cache first
    if (this.detectionCache.has(url)) {
      const handlerType = this.detectionCache.get(url);
      return this.handlers.find(h => h.type === handlerType)!;
    }
    
    // URL-based detection first (fast)
    for (const handler of this.handlers) {
      if (await handler.canHandleUrl(new URL(url))) {
        this.detectionCache.set(url, handler.type);
        return handler;
      }
    }
    
    // Content-based detection for generic types (expensive)
    // Only fetch the content once and cache it
    if (!this.pageContentCache.has(url)) {
      const content = await fetchWebPageContent(url);
      this.pageContentCache.set(url, content);
    }
    
    const pageContent = this.pageContentCache.get(url)!;
    
    // Use LLM to determine content type for generic handlers
    // Group the handlers that need content-based detection
    const genericHandlers = this.handlers.filter(
      h => h.requiresContentDetection()
    );
    
    if (genericHandlers.length > 0) {
      const contentType = await this.determineContentTypeWithLLM(
        url, pageContent, genericHandlers.map(h => h.type)
      );
      
      const handler = this.handlers.find(h => h.type === contentType);
      if (handler) {
        this.detectionCache.set(url, handler.type);
        return handler;
      }
    }
    
    throw new Error("Could not determine content type for this URL");
  }
  
  private async determineContentTypeWithLLM(
    url: string, 
    content: string, 
    possibleTypes: string[]
  ): Promise<string> {
    // Implement LLM-based content type detection
    // This is called only once per URL for generic content types
    // Return the detected content type
  }
  
  // Clear cache methods for testing and memory management
  clearCache(): void {
    this.detectionCache.clear();
    this.pageContentCache.clear();
  }
}
```

### 2.4 Enhanced Content Type Handler Interface

The content type handler interface is expanded to support the V2 requirements:

```ts
export interface ContentTypeHandler {
  type: string;
  
  // For URL-based detection
  canHandleUrl(url: URL): Promise<boolean>;
  
  // Does this handler require content-based detection?
  requiresContentDetection(): boolean;
  
  // Core functionality
  downloadContent(url: string, cachedContent?: string): Promise<any>;
  getPrompt(content: any): string;
  parseLLMResponse(response: string): any;
  validateLLMOutput(parsed: any): boolean;
  getNoteContent(llmResponse: string, metadata: ContentMetadata): string;
  getFolderName(): string;
  
  // For error handling
  getRequiredApiKeys(): string[];
}
```

### 2.5 LLM Provider Registry and Interface

A new registry to manage multiple LLM providers:

```ts
export interface LLMProvider {
  getName(): string;
  getDefaultEndpoint(): string;
  getAvailableModels(): Promise<ModelInfo[]>;
  callLLM(prompt: string, options?: LLMOptions): Promise<string>;
  validateConnection(): Promise<boolean>;
  requiresApiKey(): boolean;
  requiresEndpoint(): boolean;
}

export class LLMProviderRegistry {
  private providers: Map<string, LLMProvider> = new Map();
  
  register(provider: LLMProvider): void {
    this.providers.set(provider.getName(), provider);
  }
  
  getProvider(name: string): LLMProvider {
    const provider = this.providers.get(name);
    if (!provider) {
      throw new Error(`Provider ${name} not found`);
    }
    return provider;
  }
  
  getProviderNames(): string[] {
    return Array.from(this.providers.keys());
  }
}
```

### 2.6 Enhanced Orchestrator

The orchestrator is enhanced to work with the new registries and provide detailed progress reporting:

```ts
export class ImportPipelineOrchestrator {
  private deps: ImportPipelineDependencies;
  private progressListeners: ProgressListener[] = [];
  private errorListeners: ErrorListener[] = [];
  private completeListeners: CompleteListener[] = [];
  
  constructor(deps: ImportPipelineDependencies) {
    this.deps = deps;

### 2.7 Factory Method Enhancement

The factory method for creating the orchestrator is enhanced to work with the new architecture:

```ts
export async function createImportPipelineOrchestrator(
  app: App,
  settings: PluginSettings,
  logger: ReturnType<typeof getLogger>,
  llmProvider: LLMProvider,
  contentTypeRegistry: ContentTypeRegistry
) {
  // Create orchestrator with dependencies including the registries
  return new ImportPipelineOrchestrator({
    settings,
    llmProvider,
    noteWriter: new NoteWriter(app),
    logger,
    contentTypeRegistry
  });
}
```

## 3. Enhanced Settings

### 3.1 Provider Selection UI

```ts
export class ImprovedSettingTab extends PluginSettingTab {
  display(): void {
    const { containerEl } = this;
    
    containerEl.empty();
    
    new Setting(containerEl)
      .setName('LLM Provider')
      .setDesc('Select which provider to use for LLM processing')
      .addDropdown(dropdown => {
        // Get provider names from registry
        const providers = this.plugin.providerRegistry.getProviderNames();
        providers.forEach(providerName => {
          dropdown.addOption(providerName, providerName);
        });
        
        dropdown.setValue(this.plugin.settings.selectedProvider);
        dropdown.onChange(async (value) => {
          this.plugin.settings.selectedProvider = value;
          
          // Update provider-specific fields
          this.updateProviderSpecificSettings();
          
          await this.plugin.saveSettings();
        });
      });
      
    // Provider-specific settings container
    const providerSettingsContainer = containerEl.createDiv();
    this.renderProviderSpecificSettings(providerSettingsContainer);
  }
  
  private renderProviderSpecificSettings(container: HTMLElement): void {
    const provider = this.plugin.providerRegistry.getProvider(
      this.plugin.settings.selectedProvider
    );
    
    container.empty();
    
    // API Key if needed
    if (provider.requiresApiKey()) {
      new Setting(container)
        .setName('API Key')
        .setDesc(`API Key for ${provider.getName()}`)
        .addText(text => {
          text.setPlaceholder('Enter API key')
            .setValue(this.plugin.settings.apiKeys[provider.getName()] || '')
            .onChange(async (value) => {
              this.plugin.settings.apiKeys[provider.getName()] = value;
              await this.plugin.saveSettings();
            });
        });
    }
    
    // Endpoint if needed
    if (provider.requiresEndpoint()) {
      new Setting(container)
        .setName('Endpoint')
        .setDesc(`API Endpoint for ${provider.getName()}`)
        .addText(text => {
          text.setPlaceholder('Enter endpoint')
            .setValue(
              this.plugin.settings.endpoints[provider.getName()] || 
              provider.getDefaultEndpoint()
            )
            .onChange(async (value) => {
              this.plugin.settings.endpoints[provider.getName()] = value;
              await this.plugin.saveSettings();
            });
        });
    }
    
    // Model selection
    new Setting(container)
      .setName('Model')
      .setDesc(`Select which model to use with ${provider.getName()}`)
      .addDropdown(async dropdown => {
        try {
          const models = await provider.getAvailableModels();
          models.forEach(model => {
            dropdown.addOption(model.id, `${model.name}`);
          });
          
          dropdown.setValue(this.plugin.settings.models[provider.getName()] || models[0].id);
          dropdown.onChange(async (value) => {
            this.plugin.settings.models[provider.getName()] = value;
            await this.plugin.saveSettings();
          });
        } catch (error) {
          // Handle error getting models
          // Add a text input instead
          dropdown.addOption('custom', 'Custom Model ID');
        }
      });
  }
}
```

## 4. Error Handling Enhancement

### 4.1 Actionable Error System

```ts
export enum ErrorCategory {
  NETWORK,
  AUTHENTICATION,
  AUTHORIZATION,
  INVALID_INPUT,
  LLM_FAILURE,
  CONTENT_PROCESSING,
  NOTE_CREATION,
  UNKNOWN
}

export interface EnhancedError {
  category: ErrorCategory;
  stage: string;
  userMessage: string;
  technicalDetails?: string;
  isActionable: boolean;
  suggestedAction?: string;
  error?: unknown;
}

export function categorizeError(error: unknown, stage: string): EnhancedError {
  // Categorize errors and provide actionable information
  
  if (error instanceof NetworkError) {
    return {
      category: ErrorCategory.NETWORK,
      stage,
      userMessage: "Network connection failed",
      isActionable: true,
      suggestedAction: "Check your internet connection and try again"
    };
  }
  
  if (error instanceof AuthenticationError) {
    return {
      category: ErrorCategory.AUTHENTICATION,
      stage,
      userMessage: "Authentication failed with the LLM provider",
      isActionable: true,
      suggestedAction: "Please check your API key in the settings"
    };
  }
  
  // Additional error categories
  
  return {
    category: ErrorCategory.UNKNOWN,
    stage,
    userMessage: "An unexpected error occurred",
    isActionable: false,
    error
  };
}
```

### 4.2 Enhanced Error Handling in Orchestrator

```ts
private handleError(error: unknown, stage: string): void {
  const enhancedError = categorizeError(error, stage);
  
  // Log detailed error for developers
  this.deps.logger.error(
    `Error in ${stage}: ${enhancedError.technicalDetails || enhancedError.userMessage}`,
    enhancedError.error
  );
  
  // Only show actionable errors to users
  if (enhancedError.isActionable) {
    // Show user-friendly notice with suggested action
    new Notice(
      `${enhancedError.userMessage}. ${enhancedError.suggestedAction || ''}`,
      5000
    );
  } else {
    new Notice(
      "An error occurred during import. Check the console for details.",
      3000
    );
  }
  
  // Emit error event for UI to respond
  for (const listener of this.errorListeners) {
    listener(enhancedError);
  }
}
```

## 5. Model Implementation for Specific Content Types

### 5.1 Medium Handler

```ts
export class MediumHandler implements ContentTypeHandler {
  type = 'medium';
  
  async canHandleUrl(url: URL): Promise<boolean> {
    return url.hostname === 'medium.com' || 
           url.hostname.endsWith('.medium.com');
  }
  
  requiresContentDetection(): boolean {
    return false;
  }
  
  async downloadContent(url: string): Promise<any> {
    // Fetch the Medium article content
    const content = await fetchWebPageContent(url);
    
    // Parse important metadata
    const title = extractTitle(content);
    const author = extractAuthor(content);
    const publishedDate = extractPublishedDate(content);
    const readingTime = extractReadingTime(content);
    
    return {
      url,
      title,
      author,
      publishedDate,
      readingTime,
      content: extractMainContent(content)
    };
  }
  
  getPrompt(content: any): string {
    return `
      You are reading a Medium article titled "${content.title}" by ${content.author}.
      Please analyze this article and provide:
      1. A concise summary of the main points (3-4 sentences)
      2. 3-5 key highlights or quotes from the article
      3. A list of key topics or concepts discussed
      
      Article content:
      ${content.content}
      
      Format your response in JSON format with the following structure:
      {
        "summary": "The summary text...",
        "highlights": ["Highlight 1", "Highlight 2", ...],
        "topics": ["Topic 1", "Topic 2", ...]
      }
    `;
  }
  
  parseLLMResponse(response: string): any {
    return parseJSONFromString(response);
  }
  
  validateLLMOutput(parsed: any): boolean {
    return (
      parsed &&
      typeof parsed.summary === 'string' &&
      Array.isArray(parsed.highlights) &&
      Array.isArray(parsed.topics)
    );
  }
  
  getNoteContent(llmResponse: any, metadata: any): string {
    return `# ${metadata.title}

Author: ${metadata.author}  🔗 [Read on Medium](${metadata.url})

## Summary
${llmResponse.summary}

## Highlights
${llmResponse.highlights.map(h => `- ${h}`).join('\n')}

## Key Topics
${llmResponse.topics.map(t => `- [[${t}]]`).join('\n')}

## Metadata
- Published: ${metadata.publishedDate}
- Read time: ${metadata.readingTime}
`;
  }
  
  getFolderName(): string {
    return 'Medium Articles';
  }
  
  getRequiredApiKeys(): string[] {
    return []; // No specific API keys required for Medium
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Similar implementations for other content types

Each content type will follow a similar pattern but with specialized:
- URL detection logic
- Content extraction approach
- Prompt engineering
- Note formatting

---

## 6. LLM Provider Implementations

### 6.1 Example: Ollama Provider

```ts
export class OllamaProvider implements LLMProvider {
  getName(): string {
    return 'Ollama';
  }
  
  getDefaultEndpoint(): string {
    return 'http://localhost:11434/v1';
  }
  
  async getAvailableModels(): Promise<ModelInfo[]> {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`${this.getEndpoint()}/api/tags`);
      const data = await response.json();
      
      return data.models.map((model: any) => ({
        id: model.name,
        name: model.name,
        contextWindow: model.parameters?.context_length || 4096
      }));
    } catch (error) {
      // If can't fetch, return a default list
      return [
        { id: 'llama2', name: 'Llama 2', contextWindow: 4096 },
        { id: 'mistral', name: 'Mistral', contextWindow: 8192 },
        { id: 'orca-mini', name: 'Orca Mini', contextWindow: 4096 }
      ];
    }
  }
  
  async callLLM(prompt: string, options?: LLMOptions): Promise<string> {
    const endpoint = this.getEndpoint();
    const model = options?.model || 'llama2';
    
    const response = await fetch(`${endpoint}/api/generate`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model,
        prompt,
        stream: false
      })
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new AuthenticationError(
        `Ollama request failed: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`
      );
    }
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.response;
  }
  
  async validateConnection(): Promise<boolean> {
    try {
      await this.getAvailableModels();
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  requiresApiKey(): boolean {
    return false; // Ollama doesn't require an API key
  }
  
  requiresEndpoint(): boolean {
    return true; // Ollama requires an endpoint
  }
  
  private getEndpoint(): string {
    return this.endpoint;
  }
}
```

### 6.2 Similar implementations for other providers

Each provider will implement the same interface but with specific:
- Authentication methods
- API endpoints
- Model listing capabilities
- Error handling

---

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Performance Optimization

While most operations are I/O bound, several optimizations are implemented:

1. **Content Caching**: The content detection system caches both detection results and page content to avoid redundant network requests and LLM calls
2. **Smart Content Type Detection**: URL-based detection is attempted first before falling back to content-based detection
3. **Selective LLM Usage**: LLM is only used when necessary and with appropriately sized prompts

### 7.2 Error Recovery

The system implements intelligent error recovery:

1. **Network Retries**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient network errors
2. **LLM Response Validation**: Validation of LLM outputs with fallback to structured extraction if JSON parsing fails
3. **Partial Success**: When possible, proceed with note creation even if some metadata extraction fails

### 7.3 Security Considerations

1. **API Key Management**: Uses Obsidian's secure storage for API keys
2. **URL Validation**: Validates and sanitizes URLs before processing
3. **Content Sanitization**: Sanitizes content before processing and note creation
4. **Error Redaction**: Ensures API keys and sensitive information aren't exposed in error messages

---

## 8. Testing Strategy

### 8.1 Unit Tests

- Content type handlers
- LLM providers
- URL validation and sanitization
- Error handling

### 8.2 Integration Tests

- End-to-end import process
- Content type detection system
- Provider switching

### 8.3 Mock Testing

- LLM responses
- Network requests
- File operations

---

## 9. Conclusion

This architecture builds upon the solid foundation of the MVP while adding the flexibility needed for V2's expanded capabilities. The key enhancements are:

1. **Content Type Registry**: For managing and efficiently using multiple content handlers
2. **Provider Registry**: For flexible LLM provider selection
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: For more actionable user feedback
4. **Improved UI**: For better user experience and progress reporting

The design maintains the orchestrator-based approach while providing clear extension points for future enhancement.

kpiteira: I think this is a solid proposal, thank you. The main comment I'd make is that for the LLMProviders, since they are all based on OpenAI, we should probably have a base implementation that is common to call the LLM, and then specialization for obtaining models, endpoints, ...
something like OpenAIProvider partially implements LLMProvider for tha callLLM method, and then all the other providers extend/implement OpenAIProvider with their specific overiding specificity. What do you think?

GitHub Copilot: That's an excellent point about the LLM providers! Since they all use the OpenAI-compatible API format, creating a base implementation would definitely improve code reuse and maintainability.

Let's refine the LLM Provider architecture to follow this approach:

```typescript
// Base provider implementation for OpenAI-compatible APIs
export abstract class BaseOpenAIProvider implements LLMProvider {
  protected apiKey: string;
  protected endpoint: string;
  protected modelId: string;

  constructor(apiKey: string, endpoint: string, modelId: string) {
    this.apiKey = apiKey;
    this.endpoint = endpoint;
    this.modelId = modelId;
  }

  // Shared implementation for all OpenAI-compatible APIs
  async callLLM(prompt: string, options?: LLMOptions): Promise<string> {
    const endpoint = options?.endpoint || this.endpoint;
    const model = options?.model || this.modelId;
    
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`${endpoint}/chat/completions`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.apiKey}`
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          model: model,
          messages: [
            { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant that analyzes content.' },
            { role: 'user', content: prompt }
          ],
          temperature: options?.temperature || 0.3,
          max_tokens: options?.maxTokens || 1000
        })
      });

      throw new Error(`Ollama request failed: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`);
    }
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.response;
  }

  // Other methods as required by the LLMProvider interface
  // ...
}
```

This architecture provides several advantages:

1. **Code Reuse**: The common OpenAI-compatible API logic is implemented once in the `BaseOpenAIProvider`
2. **Consistency**: All OpenAI-compatible providers behave predictably for the core functionality
3. **Customization**: Each provider can still implement its own logic for specific requirements
4. **Flexibility**: Non-OpenAI providers can still implement the same interface directly
5. **Maintenance**: When the OpenAI API changes, we only need to update the base class

Is this approach aligned with what you had in mind? And would you like to make any adjustments to how the base class is structured or how the provider-specific implementations work?

kpiteira: completely, thank you! Let's update the architecture doc with that please, then I'll save it

GitHub Copilot: I'll update the LLM provider section in the architecture document to incorporate the base class approach. Here's the revised section:

## 2.5 LLM Provider Registry and Interface

The LLM provider architecture follows a hierarchy pattern to maximize code reuse while maintaining flexibility:

```typescript
// Base LLM Provider Interface
export interface LLMProvider {
  getName(): string;
  getDefaultEndpoint(): string;
  getAvailableModels(): Promise<ModelInfo[]>;
  callLLM(prompt: string, options?: LLMOptions): Promise<string>;
  validateConnection(): Promise<boolean>;
  requiresApiKey(): boolean;
  requiresEndpoint(): boolean;
}

// Base class for OpenAI-compatible providers
export abstract class BaseOpenAIProvider implements LLMProvider {
  protected apiKey: string;
  protected endpoint: string;
  protected modelId: string;

  constructor(apiKey: string, endpoint: string, modelId: string) {
    this.apiKey = apiKey;
    this.endpoint = endpoint;
    this.modelId = modelId;
  }

  // Shared implementation for all OpenAI-compatible APIs
  async callLLM(prompt: string, options?: LLMOptions): Promise<string> {
    const endpoint = options?.endpoint || this.endpoint;
    const model = options?.model || this.modelId;
    
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`${endpoint}/chat/completions`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.apiKey}`
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          model: model,
          messages: [
            { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant that analyzes content.' },
            { role: 'user', content: prompt }
          ],
          temperature: options?.temperature || 0.3,
          max_tokens: options?.maxTokens || 1000
        })
      });
      
      if (!response.ok) {
        const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => ({}));
        throw new LLMAPIError(
          `API request failed: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`,
          response.status,
          errorData
        );
      }
      
      const data = await response.json();
      return data.choices[0].message.content;
    } catch (error) {
      // Enhanced error handling with provider-specific context
      if (error instanceof LLMAPIError) {
        throw error;
      }
      throw new LLMAPIError(`Error calling ${this.getName()} API: ${error.message}`, 500, {});
    }
  }

  // Methods that must be implemented by specific providers
  abstract getName(): string;
  abstract getDefaultEndpoint(): string;
  abstract getAvailableModels(): Promise<ModelInfo[]>;
  
  // Default implementations that can be overridden
  async validateConnection(): Promise<boolean> {
    try {
      await this.getAvailableModels();
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  requiresApiKey(): boolean {
    return true; // Most OpenAI-compatible providers require an API key
  }
  
  requiresEndpoint(): boolean {
    return true; // Most OpenAI-compatible providers allow custom endpoints
  }
}

// Provider registry for managing multiple LLM providers
export class LLMProviderRegistry {
  private providers: Map<string, LLMProvider> = new Map();
  
  register(provider: LLMProvider): void {
    this.providers.set(provider.getName(), provider);
  }
  
  getProvider(name: string): LLMProvider {
    const provider = this.providers.get(name);
    if (!provider) {
      throw new Error(`Provider ${name} not found`);
    }
    return provider;
  }
  
  getProviderNames(): string[] {
    return Array.from(this.providers.keys());
  }
}
```

## 6. LLM Provider Implementations

### 6.1 OpenAI-Compatible Providers

```typescript
// OpenAI Provider
export class OpenAIProvider extends BaseOpenAIProvider {
  getName(): string {
    return 'OpenAI';
  }
  
  getDefaultEndpoint(): string {
    return 'https://api.openai.com/v1';
  }
  
  async getAvailableModels(): Promise<ModelInfo[]> {
    // OpenAI-specific implementation for listing models
    const response = await fetch(`${this.endpoint}/models`, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.apiKey}`
      }
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to fetch models: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`);
    }
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.data
      .filter((model: any) => model.id.includes('gpt'))
      .map((model: any) => ({
        id: model.id,
        name: model.id,
        contextWindow: getContextWindowForModel(model.id)
      }));
  }
}

// Requesty Provider
export class RequestyProvider extends BaseOpenAIProvider {
  getName(): string {
    return 'Requesty';
  }
  
  getDefaultEndpoint(): string {
    return 'https://api.requesty.ai/v1';
  }
  
  async getAvailableModels(): Promise<ModelInfo[]> {
    // Requesty-specific implementation or a curated list if API doesn't provide one
    return [
      { id: 'gpt-4', name: 'GPT-4', contextWindow: 8192 },
      { id: 'gpt-3.5-turbo', name: 'GPT-3.5 Turbo', contextWindow: 4096 },
      { id: 'claude-3-opus', name: 'Claude 3 Opus', contextWindow: 100000 },
      { id: 'claude-3-sonnet', name: 'Claude 3 Sonnet', contextWindow: 100000 }
    ];
  }
}

// OpenRouter Provider
export class OpenRouterProvider extends BaseOpenAIProvider {
  getName(): string {
    return 'OpenRouter';
  }
  
  getDefaultEndpoint(): string {
    return 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1';
  }
  
  async getAvailableModels(): Promise<ModelInfo[]> {
    // OpenRouter has an API endpoint to list models
    const response = await fetch(`${this.endpoint}/models`, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.apiKey}`,
        'HTTP-Referer': 'https://obsidian.md/plugins', // OpenRouter requires this header
        'X-Title': 'Obsidian Importer'
      }
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to fetch models: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`);
    }
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.data.map((model: any) => ({
      id: model.id,
      name: model.name || model.id,
      contextWindow: model.context_length || 4096
    }));
  }
  
  // Override the callLLM method to add OpenRouter-specific headers
  async callLLM(prompt: string, options?: LLMOptions): Promise<string> {
    const customOptions = {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        'HTTP-Referer': 'https://obsidian.md/plugins',
        'X-Title': 'Obsidian Importer'
      }
    };
    return super.callLLM(prompt, customOptions);
  }
}
```

### 6.2 Non-OpenAI Providers

```typescript
// Ollama Provider (non-OpenAI compatible)
export class OllamaProvider implements LLMProvider {
  private endpoint: string;
  private modelId: string;

  constructor(endpoint: string, modelId: string) {
    this.endpoint = endpoint;
    this.modelId = modelId;
  }

  getName(): string {
    return 'Ollama';
  }
  
  getDefaultEndpoint(): string {
    return 'http://localhost:11434';
  }
  
  // Custom implementation specific to Ollama's API
  async callLLM(prompt: string, options?: LLMOptions): Promise<string> {
    const endpoint = options?.endpoint || this.endpoint;
    const model = options?.model || this.modelId;
    
    const response = await fetch(`${endpoint}/api/generate`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model,
        prompt,
        stream: false
      })
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Ollama request failed: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`);
    }
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.response;
  }
  
  async getAvailableModels(): Promise<ModelInfo[]> {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`${this.endpoint}/api/tags`);
      const data = await response.json();
      
      return data.models.map((model: any) => ({
        id: model.name,
        name: model.name,
        contextWindow: model.parameters?.context_length || 4096
      }));
    } catch (error) {
      // If can't fetch, return a default list
      return [
        { id: 'llama2', name: 'Llama 2', contextWindow: 4096 },
        { id: 'mistral', name: 'Mistral', contextWindow: 8192 },
        { id: 'orca-mini', name: 'Orca Mini', contextWindow: 4096 }
      ];
    }
  }
  
  validateConnection(): Promise<boolean> {
    return this.getAvailableModels().then(() => true).catch(() => false);
  }
  
  requiresApiKey(): boolean {
    return false; // Ollama doesn't require an API key
  }
  
  requiresEndpoint(): boolean {
    return true; // Ollama requires an endpoint
  }
}
```

This implementation improves the architecture by:

1. **Maximizing Code Reuse**: The `BaseOpenAIProvider` implements the common OpenAI-compatible API logic once
2. **Maintaining Type Safety**: All providers implement the same `LLMProvider` interface
3. **Supporting Specialization**: Each provider can customize behavior where needed
4. **Enabling Extension**: New providers can be added by extending the base class or implementing the interface directly
5. **Simplifying Integration**: The provider registry makes it easy to manage multiple providers

This approach will make the codebase more maintainable and extensible as you add support for additional LLM providers in the future.

kpiteira: Great. When implementing the MVP, I used a detailed task list as attached which purpose was to be implemented by an AI. However it gave me a lot of trouble as the implementation constantely focused on the local parts, with no stitching together along the way, and I had a lot of work to do afterward to untangle a lot of local choices that were ok for the given task but weren't very good in the overall architecture.
I'd like your help to generate a very detailed task list, but taking into account this feedback. Feel free to recommend a different format, and please, let's make sure that we can test the functionnality along the way, with a project that evolves as we implement the various tasks and is testable in the plugin at least at the major task level.

GitHub Copilot: I understand your concern about the previous task list leading to disjointed implementation. Let's create a more cohesive approach that ensures we build V2 incrementally with testable milestones along the way.

Here's a different format that focuses on vertical slices of functionality instead of horizontally divided tasks:

---

## Testing Strategy

For each slice:

1. **Unit tests** focus on the specific components being modified
2. **Integration tests** verify the end-to-end flow for that slice
3. **Manual verification** ensures the plugin works in Obsidian

After each slice is completed, you'll have a working plugin that can be tested with real content, making it easier to identify and fix issues before moving to the next slice.

## Development Workflow

1. Complete one slice at a time
2. Verify the plugin works end-to-end after each slice
3. Commit changes with descriptive messages related to the slice
4. If issues are found with previous slices, fix them before continuing

This approach ensures that at any point in development, you have a working plugin with clearly defined functionality.

kpiteira: Perfect, thank you! Do you have a suggestion about how I should prompt the AI to implement a given slice? Should I provide it the architecture document, or the prd too? the entire task list or just the slice?

GitHub Copilot: For the most effective implementation, I recommend a structured approach when prompting the AI to implement a specific slice. Here's how I would suggest doing it:

### Optimal Prompting Strategy for Slice Implementation

1. **Start with the specific slice context**:
   - Provide the specific slice details from the task list
   - Include the goal statement so the AI understands the purpose

2. **Add relevant architectural context**:
   - Include only the sections from the architecture document that are directly relevant to the slice
   - For example, for a provider implementation, include the LLM Provider interface and base classes

3. **Include minimal PRD context**:
   - Provide only the PRD sections that define requirements for the specific functionality

4. **Show existing related code**:
   - Share relevant existing code that the new implementation needs to integrate with
   - For early slices, include core orchestrator code to show how components connect

5. **Request specific deliverables**:
   - Ask for all files that need to be created or modified
   - Request tests that demonstrate the functionality works

### Example Prompt Template

```
I'm implementing Slice X.Y: [Slice Title] from my Obsidian Importer V2 plan.

Goal: [Insert goal from task list]

The implementation tasks are:
[List specific implementation points from the slice]

Here are the relevant sections from my architecture document:
[Paste only relevant architecture sections]

The relevant requirements from the PRD are:
[Paste only relevant PRD sections]

Here's the existing related code that this needs to integrate with:
[Paste relevant existing code]

Please provide:
1. All files that need to be created or modified with complete implementations
2. Unit tests that verify the core functionality
3. Any integration code needed to connect this with existing components
4. Instructions for manually testing this slice in Obsidian

When complete, I should be able to [describe expected testable outcome].
```

This approach gives the AI enough context to understand what needs to be built and how it fits into the larger system, while avoiding overwhelming it with irrelevant information. It also explicitly requests complete deliverables that you can directly implement and test.

As you progress through the slices, you can reference previously implemented slices when they're relevant to the current work, which provides continuity while maintaining focus on the current task.

kpiteira: Do you think you could go meta and design a prompt to ask the AI to generate the prompt following the template you provided above, with all the relevant information to describe a given slice, based on the prd and architecture doc and codebase? I want to use the fullest of AI's power :)

GitHub Copilot: I'd be happy to design a meta-prompt that helps you generate slice-specific implementation prompts. This approach will leverage AI to prepare the optimal context for each implementation task:

# Meta-Prompt for Generating Slice Implementation Prompts

```
I'm preparing to implement Slice [X.Y: Slice Title] from my Obsidian Importer V2 plan. Before I start coding, I'd like you to help me create a comprehensive implementation prompt that I can use with an AI coding assistant.

Here's the slice I want to implement:

[Paste the complete slice section from the task list]

I have these documents available:
1. A V2 PRD document
2. A V2 Architecture document
3. My existing codebase

Please generate a well-structured implementation prompt following this template:

---
I'm implementing Slice [X.Y: Slice Title] from my Obsidian Importer V2 plan.

Goal: [Extract the goal from the slice]

The implementation tasks are:
[Format the implementation points from the slice as a clear list]

Here are the relevant sections from my architecture document:
[Please identify and extract ONLY the most relevant sections from this architecture document that directly relate to this slice]

The relevant requirements from the PRD are:
[Please identify and extract ONLY the most relevant requirements from this PRD document that directly relate to this slice]

Here's the existing related code that this needs to integrate with:
[Please identify key files/components from the current structure that will need to interact with this implementation]

Please provide:
1. All files that need to be created or modified with complete implementations
2. Unit tests that verify the core functionality
3. Any integration code needed to connect this with existing components
4. Instructions for manually testing this slice in Obsidian

When complete, I should be able to [describe the expected testable outcome based on the slice goal].
---

For you to generate this prompt properly, I'll now provide:
1. The relevant section from my V2 Architecture document
2. The relevant section from my V2 PRD
3. Key information about my existing codebase structure and relevant files

[Paste architecture document or sections]

[Paste PRD document or sections]

[Describe/paste key information about your codebase structure]
```

This meta-prompt:

1. Asks the AI to extract only the most relevant information from your documentation
2. Formats the implementation tasks clearly
3. Identifies the existing code components that will interact with the new implementation
4. Creates a focused, actionable implementation prompt

When you receive the generated implementation prompt, you can review it to ensure it contains all necessary context before using it with your coding assistant. This approach helps streamline your workflow by delegating the context-gathering to the AI while maintaining control over the final implementation prompt.

kpiteira: Let's test this for the very first slice! I added all the relevant documents. Can you try it?

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you generate a meta-prompt for implementing the first slice from your V2 plan. Let's apply the template to Slice 1.1: Base Provider Interface and Registry.

# Meta-Prompt for Slice 1.1 Implementation

```
I'm preparing to implement Slice 1.1: Base Provider Interface and Registry from my Obsidian Importer V2 plan. Before I start coding, I'd like you to help me create a comprehensive implementation prompt that I can use with an AI coding assistant.

Here's the slice I want to implement:

### Slice 1.1: Base Provider Interface and Registry
- [ ] **Implementation**:
  - Create `LLMProvider` interface with core methods
  - Implement abstract `BaseOpenAIProvider` class for common functionality
  - Create `LLMProviderRegistry` to manage providers

  - Verify provider registration/retrieval works as expected

Please generate a well-structured implementation prompt following this template:

Goal: Refactor the LLM service to support multiple providers while maintaining existing YouTube functionality.

The implementation tasks are:
- Create `LLMProvider` interface with core methods
- Implement abstract `BaseOpenAIProvider` class for common functionality
- Create `LLMProviderRegistry` to manage providers
- Refactor existing provider as subclass of `BaseOpenAIProvider`
- Update factory to use the new provider structure
- Ensure existing YouTube functionality works with refactored provider

Here are the relevant sections from my architecture document:
[Please identify and extract ONLY the most relevant sections from the architecture document that directly relate to this slice]

The relevant requirements from the PRD are:
[Please identify and extract ONLY the most relevant requirements from this PRD document that directly relate to this slice]

Here's the existing related code that this needs to integrate with:
[Please identify key files/components from the current structure that will need to interact with this implementation]

Please provide:
1. All files that need to be created or modified with complete implementations
2. Unit tests that verify the core functionality
3. Any integration code needed to connect this with existing components
4. Instructions for manually testing this slice in Obsidian

When complete, I should be able to [describe the expected testable outcome based on the slice goal].
---

I'll provide the necessary context from my documents:
1. V2 Architecture document (focusing on LLM Provider sections)
2. V2 PRD (focusing on Enhanced LLM Integration)
3. Information about my existing codebase structure, particularly around the current LLM implementation

[For the architecture, please focus on section 2.5 LLM Provider Registry and Interface, and 6. LLM Provider Implementations]

[For the PRD, please focus on section 3. Enhanced LLM Integration]

[For my existing codebase, we need to know how my current LLM provider is implemented and how it integrates with the orchestrator]
```

This meta-prompt is structured to help the AI generate a focused implementation prompt with all the necessary context for Slice 1.1. To create prompts for subsequent slices, you'd follow the same pattern but reference the appropriate slice details from your task list.

Would you like me to refine this meta-prompt further, or would you prefer to see what an actual implementation prompt would look like for Slice 1.1?

kpiteira: Ok, I'm going to test it with you:

# Implementation Prompt for Slice 1.1: Base Provider Interface and Registry

```
I'm implementing Slice 1.1: Base Provider Interface and Registry from my Obsidian Importer V2 plan.

Goal: Refactor the LLM service to support multiple providers while maintaining existing YouTube functionality.

The implementation tasks are:
- Create `LLMProvider` interface with core methods
- Implement abstract `BaseOpenAIProvider` class for common functionality
- Create `LLMProviderRegistry` to manage providers
- Refactor existing provider as subclass of `BaseOpenAIProvider`
- Update factory to use the new provider structure
- Ensure existing YouTube functionality works with refactored provider

Here are the relevant sections from my architecture document:

## LLM Provider Registry and Interface

The LLM provider architecture follows a hierarchy pattern to maximize code reuse while maintaining flexibility:

```typescript
// Base LLM Provider Interface
export interface LLMProvider {
  getName(): string;
  getDefaultEndpoint(): string;
  getAvailableModels(): Promise<ModelInfo[]>;
  callLLM(prompt: string, options?: LLMOptions): Promise<string>;
  validateConnection(): Promise<boolean>;
  requiresApiKey(): boolean;
  requiresEndpoint(): boolean;
}

// Base class for OpenAI-compatible providers
export abstract class BaseOpenAIProvider implements LLMProvider {
  protected apiKey: string;
  protected endpoint: string;
  protected modelId: string;

  constructor(apiKey: string, endpoint: string, modelId: string) {
    this.apiKey = apiKey;
    this.endpoint = endpoint;
    this.modelId = modelId;
  }

  // Shared implementation for all OpenAI-compatible APIs
  async callLLM(prompt: string, options?: LLMOptions): Promise<string> {
    const endpoint = options?.endpoint || this.endpoint;
    const model = options?.model || this.modelId;
    
    // Implementation details
  }

  // Abstract methods to be implemented by specific providers
  abstract getName(): string;
  abstract getDefaultEndpoint(): string;
  abstract getAvailableModels(): Promise<ModelInfo[]>;
  
  // Default implementations that can be overridden
  async validateConnection(): Promise<boolean> {
    try {
      await this.getAvailableModels();
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  requiresApiKey(): boolean {
    return true; // Most OpenAI-compatible providers require an API key
  }
  
  requiresEndpoint(): boolean {
    return true; // Most OpenAI-compatible providers allow custom endpoints
  }
}

// Provider registry for managing multiple LLM providers
export class LLMProviderRegistry {
  private providers: Map<string, LLMProvider> = new Map();
  
  register(provider: LLMProvider): void {
    this.providers.set(provider.getName(), provider);
  }
  
  getProvider(name: string): LLMProvider {
    const provider = this.providers.get(name);
    if (!provider) {
      throw new Error(`Provider ${name} not found`);
    }
    return provider;
  }
  
  getProviderNames(): string[] {
    return Array.from(this.providers.keys());
  }
}
```

## Factory Method Enhancement

```ts
export async function createImportPipelineOrchestrator(
  app: App,
  settings: PluginSettings,
  logger: ReturnType<typeof getLogger>,
  llmProvider: LLMProvider,
  contentTypeRegistry: ContentTypeRegistry
) {
  // Create orchestrator with dependencies including the registries
  return new ImportPipelineOrchestrator({
    settings,
    llmProvider,
    noteWriter: new NoteWriter(app),
    logger,
    contentTypeRegistry
  });
}
```

The relevant requirements from the PRD are:

### Enhanced LLM Integration

- Implement a dropdown menu in settings for selecting LLM providers:
  - Requesty
  - OpenRouter
  - OpenAI
  - Local (e.g., Ollama)
- Remote Providers: Auto-configure endpoints based on provider selection
- Local Provider: Additional field for specifying endpoint URL
- Implement a model selection dropdown that updates based on selected provider
- Use Obsidian's secret management system to securely store API keys
- Remember previously entered keys for each provider
- Implement a "Test Connection" button to validate API settings

Here's the existing related code that this needs to integrate with:

```typescript
// The current provider implementation
export class RequestyProvider {
  private apiKey: string;
  
  constructor(apiKeyGetter: () => string) {
    this.apiKey = apiKeyGetter();
  }
  
  async callLLM(prompt: string): Promise<string> {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.requesty.ai/v1/chat/completions", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${this.apiKey}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: "gpt-4-turbo",
        messages: [
          { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant that analyzes content." },
          { role: "user", content: prompt }
        ],
        temperature: 0.3
      })
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Requesty API request failed: ${response.status}`);
    }
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.choices[0].message.content;
  }
}

// The current factory function that creates the orchestrator
export async function createImportPipelineOrchestrator(app: App, settings: PluginSettings, logger: ReturnType<typeof getLogger>) {
  // Create Requesty provider
  const requestyProvider = new RequestyProvider(() => settings.apiKey);
  
  // Use note writer
  const noteWriter = new NoteWriter(app);
  
  // Create orchestrator with dependencies
  return new ImportPipelineOrchestrator({
    settings,
    llmProvider: requestyProvider,
    noteWriter,
    logger
  });
}

// Current plugin settings interface
export interface PluginSettings {
  apiKey: string;
  debug: boolean;
}

// The orchestrator that uses the provider
export class ImportPipelineOrchestrator {
  private deps: {
    settings: PluginSettings;
    llmProvider: RequestyProvider;
    noteWriter: NoteWriter;
    logger: Logger;
  };
  
  constructor(deps: {
    settings: PluginSettings;
    llmProvider: RequestyProvider;
    noteWriter: NoteWriter;
    logger: Logger;
  }) {
    this.deps = deps;
  }
  
  async processWithLLM(prompt: string): Promise<string> {
    return this.deps.llmProvider.callLLM(prompt);
  }
  
  // Other methods
}
```

Please provide:
1. All files that need to be created or modified with complete implementations
2. Unit tests that verify the core functionality
3. Any integration code needed to connect this with existing components
4. Instructions for manually testing this slice in Obsidian

When complete, I should be able to use my existing YouTube import functionality with the new provider architecture, and have the foundation in place for adding additional providers in future slices.
```

This implementation prompt gives the AI coder everything they need to implement Slice 1.1, including:

1. The clear goal and tasks
2. The relevant architecture design for LLM providers
3. The PRD requirements specifically for LLM integration
4. The existing code structure they need to modify
5. Clear expectations for deliverables and testing criteria

The AI can now produce a complete implementation that follows your architectural design while ensuring the existing functionality continues to work.This implementation prompt gives the AI coder everything they need to implement Slice 1.1, including:

kpiteira: You are a marvel, thank you!

GitHub Copilot: You're welcome! I'm glad the implementation prompt structure works well for your needs. This approach should help you get high-quality, focused implementations for each slice of your V2 plan.

For subsequent slices, you can follow the same meta-prompt pattern, just updating the slice details and relevant documentation sections. As you progress through the implementation, you can also reference previously completed slices when relevant.

The vertical slice approach, combined with these focused implementation prompts, should help you avoid the disjointed implementation issues you experienced with your MVP development. Each slice will build on the previous ones while maintaining a working plugin at each step.

Good luck with your implementation! If you need help with any other slices or have questions about the implementation process, feel free to ask.
