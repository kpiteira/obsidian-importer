We are continuing the implementation of my Obsidian Importer with the v2. Here is the next task on the list:
I'm implementing Slice 3.1: Medium Handler Implementation from my Obsidian Importer V2 plan.

Goal: Add support for Medium articles as the first new content type.

The implementation tasks are:
1. Create `MediumHandler` class implementing `ContentTypeHandler`
2. Implement URL-based detection for Medium domains
3. Create web scraper for Medium article content
4. Implement Medium-specific prompt template
5. Register Medium handler with content type registry
6. Update note creation to handle Medium article format
7. Create Medium article template renderer
8. Test end-to-end Medium article import

Here are the relevant sections from my architecture document:
```typescript
// Example Medium Handler implementation
export class MediumHandler implements ContentTypeHandler {
  type = 'medium';
  
  async canHandleUrl(url: URL): Promise<boolean> {
    return url.hostname === 'medium.com' || 
           url.hostname.endsWith('.medium.com');
  }
  
  requiresContentDetection(): boolean {
    return false;
  }
  
  async downloadContent(url: string): Promise<any> {
    // Fetch the Medium article content
    const content = await fetchWebPageContent(url);
    
    // Parse important metadata
    const title = extractTitle(content);
    const author = extractAuthor(content);
    const publishedDate = extractPublishedDate(content);
    const readingTime = extractReadingTime(content);
    
    return {
      url,
      title,
      author,
      publishedDate,
      readingTime,
      content: extractMainContent(content)
    };
  }
  
  getPrompt(content: any): string {
    return `
      You are reading a Medium article titled "${content.title}" by ${content.author}.
      Please analyze this article and provide:
      1. A concise summary of the main points (3-4 sentences)
      2. 3-5 key highlights or quotes from the article
      3. A list of key topics or concepts discussed
      
      Article content:
      ${content.content}
      
      Format your response in JSON format with the following structure:
      {
        "summary": "The summary text...",
        "highlights": ["Highlight 1", "Highlight 2", ...],
        "topics": ["Topic 1", "Topic 2", ...]
      }
    `;
  }
}
```

The relevant requirements from the PRD are:
```markdown
#### ðŸ“„ Medium Article Template
# {{title}}

Author: {{author}}  ðŸ”— [Read on Medium]({{article_url}})

## Summary
{{summary}}

## Highlights
{{highlights}}

## Key Topics
{{key_topics}}

## Metadata
- Published: {{published_date}}
- Read time: {{read_time}}
```

Here's the existing related code that this needs to integrate with:
1. ContentTypeHandler.ts - Defines the interface that MediumHandler must implement
2. ContentTypeRegistry.ts - Used to register the new handler
3. The existing YouTubeHandler.ts provides a reference implementation

Please provide:
1. All files that need to be created or modified with complete implementations
2. Unit tests that verify the core functionality
3. Any integration code needed to connect this with existing components
4. Instructions for manually testing this slice in Obsidian
5. Ensure the build and tests pass, but only those that were written in this task

When complete, I should be able to import a Medium article URL, have the system detect it's a Medium article, process it with my chosen LLM provider, and create a properly formatted note in Obsidian with the article's summary, highlights, and key topics.
