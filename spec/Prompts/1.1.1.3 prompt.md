Objective: Create the necessary source code folder structure for the Obsidian Importer plugin.

Task Definition (from obsidian_importer_detailed_tasks.md):
- [ ] Task 1.1.1.3: Create folder structure according to architecture doc: `src/handlers/`, `src/ui/`, `src/utils/`, `src/models/`, `src/services/`

Architectural Context (from obsidian_importer_architecture.md, Section 4.1):
- The recommended file structure organizes code into logical components:
  ```
  obsidian-importer/
  ├── src/                     # Main source code folder
  │   ├── handlers/            # Core pipeline components (detection, download, process, write)
  │   ├── ui/                  # Modals, settings tabs
  │   ├── utils/               # Helper functions (validation, sanitization)
  │   ├── models/              # Data interfaces (e.g., YouTubeVideoData, PluginSettings)
  │   ├── services/            # External service interactions (e.g., LLM API calls)
  │   └── main.ts              # Plugin entry point
  ├── tests/                   # Test files
  ├── manifest.json
  ├── tsconfig.json
  └── package.json
  ```
- Note: `main.ts` likely already exists in the template's `src/` or root; it should remain.

Instructions:
- Generate a list of shell commands (e.g., `mkdir`) to create the following directories inside the `src/` folder of the project:
  - `handlers`
  - `ui`
  - `utils`
  - `models`
  - `services`
- Assume the commands are run from the project's root directory.
