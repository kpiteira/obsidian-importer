Objective: Set up the testing environment using Vitest for the Obsidian Importer plugin.

Task Definition (from obsidian_importer_detailed_tasks.md):
- [ ] Task 1.1.2.3: Set up testing environment with Vitest and create initial test structure in a `tests/` folder

Architectural Context (from obsidian_importer_architecture.md, Section 4.2):
- Recommends using Vitest for testing.
- Suggests a `tests/` folder mirroring the `src/` structure where appropriate.
- Suggests storing fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`.

Instructions:
1.  List the necessary npm dev dependencies to install for Vitest (`vitest`, potentially `@vitest/ui`, `jsdom` or similar for mocking browser/Obsidian APIs if needed).
2.  Provide the command(s) to create the initial test directory structure:
    - `tests/handlers/`
    - `tests/ui/`
    - `tests/utils/`
    - `tests/fixtures/`
3.  Suggest a basic npm script in `package.json` to run the tests, e.g., `"test": "vitest"`.
